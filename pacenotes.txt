- you can't read/write without seek
- if you write disk blocks - than performance skyrockets (x5, bufio)
- context switches are evil
- buffered sequential read is x10 times faster than random one
- channels & mutexes
- uint64 is 16 million terabytes (what if offset is gt uint64?)
- different order of magnitude (23 ms to 1 ms)

# Combustor splits into chunks sequentially... % config.MaxRecordsPerFile
# FCU iterates between tail -> head % config.MaxRecordsPerFile
# if head % config.MaxRecordsPerFile > #chunk, then remove chunk!

TODO:
- store data in chunk files   (Wed)
- create throughput benchmark (Thu)
- beef up comments and README (Fri)
